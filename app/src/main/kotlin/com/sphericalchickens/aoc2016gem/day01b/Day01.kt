 * This makes the code easier to understand, not just as a set of instructions for the computer, but as a

 *
 * The key design decision here is to solve both parts in a single pass over the instructions.
 * This is more efficient than processing the instructions twice.
 *
 * The function first parses the input string into a sequence of `Instruction`s.
 * Then, it uses the `fold` function to process the instructions. `fold` is a powerful
 * functional programming tool that allows us to accumulate a state over a sequence.
 * In this case, the state is represented by the `State` data class.
 *
 * After processing all instructions, the final state contains everything we need to calculate
 * the answers for both parts.
