A distraught farmer approaches a team of university professors—a mechanical engineer, a chemist, and a theoretical physicist—with a serious problem: his chickens are not laying eggs.

The mechanical engineer suggests checking the feed-delivery mechanism for friction losses and ensuring the ambient temperature is optimized.

The chemist suggests analyzing the chicken feed's nutritional content, the water supply's mineral balance, and testing the hens' blood for vitamin deficiencies.

The theoretical physicist says, "I can solve this. But first, I will need to make some simplifying assumptions."

The farmer and the other professors wait expectantly.

The physicist begins, "First, assume perfectly spherical chickens in a frictionless vacuum..."
