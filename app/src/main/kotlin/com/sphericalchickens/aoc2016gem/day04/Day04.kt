/**
 * This file provides a refactored solution for Advent of Code 2016, Day 4.
 * It follows the principles of literate programming, where the code and its explanation
 * are woven together to form a coherent narrative. The program's primary goal is to
 * validate and decrypt room codes to find the sum of sector IDs for real rooms and
 * to locate a specific room related to "north pole objects".
 *
 * The core of this solution is the `Room` data class. It encapsulates all the logic
 * related to a single room: parsing, validation, and decryption. This approach
 * provides a clean, object-oriented design where each object is self-sufficient.
