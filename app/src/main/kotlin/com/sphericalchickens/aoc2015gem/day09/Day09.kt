/**
 * # Advent of Code 2015, Day 9: All in a Single Night
 *
 * This program finds the shortest and longest possible routes that visit a set of
 * locations exactly once, a classic computer science problem known as the
 * Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).
 *
 * ## Approach
 * 1.  **Parse Input**: The input, which lists distances between pairs of cities, is
 * parsed into a graph data structure. We use an adjacency map (`Map<String, Map<String, Int>>`)
 * for efficient O(1) distance lookups between any two connected cities.
 * 2.  **Generate Routes**: Since the number of cities is small, we can solve this by
 * brute force. We generate every possible unique route (permutation) that visits
 * each city exactly once.
 * 3.  **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, we calculate the total distance of
 * the route by summing the distances of each leg of the journey.
 * 4.  **Find Extrema**: Finally, we find the minimum and maximum values from our list of
 * total route distances to get the answers for Part 1 and Part 2.
