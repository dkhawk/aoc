/**
 * # Advent of Code 2015, Day 3: Perfectly Spherical Houses in a Vacuum
 *
 * This program solves a puzzle about calculating the number of unique houses Santa
 * visits on an infinite 2D grid based on a sequence of movement instructions.
 *
 * ## Principles Applied
 * 1.  **Literate Programming**: The code is structured to be read top-down. The `main`
 * function acts as a narrative, guiding the reader through the process of testing
 * the logic and solving both parts of the puzzle.
 * 2.  **Idiomatic Kotlin & Functional Style**:
 * - The stateful `Entity` class has been replaced with a functional approach.
 * - The `scan` function is used to transform a sequence of movement characters into
 * a sequence of coordinates, which is a perfect use case for tracking accumulated state.
 * - For Part 2, `filterIndexed` provides a clean, declarative way to partition the
 * instructions for Santa and Robo-Santa without manual iteration.
 * - A central, reusable helper function, `getVisitedHouses`, encapsulates the core
 * logic of calculating a path from instructions.
