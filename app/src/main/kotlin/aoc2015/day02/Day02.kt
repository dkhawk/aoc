/**
 * # Advent of Code 2015, Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math
 *
 * This program solves the puzzle by calculating the amount of wrapping paper and ribbon
 * needed for a list of presents. The logic is structured to be read top-down,
 * starting with the main execution function.
 *
 * ## Principles Applied
 * 1.  **Literate Programming**: The code is organized to be explanatory. The `main` function
 * reads like a set of instructions, and documentation explains the purpose of each part.
 * 2.  **Idiomatic Kotlin**: We use features like data classes, companion object factories,
 * the `sumOf` aggregate function, and `lazy` initialization to write concise and readable code.
 * 3.  **Data-Oriented Design**: A `Box` data class is introduced to represent a present,
 * encapsulating its dimensions and related calculations. This replaces scattered extension
 * functions and makes the logic much cleaner.
