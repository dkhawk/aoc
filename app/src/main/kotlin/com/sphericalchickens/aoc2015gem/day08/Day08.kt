/**
 * # Advent of Code 2015, Day 8: Matchsticks
 *
 * This program solves a puzzle about the difference between the number of characters
 * in a string's code representation (the raw string literal) and the number of
 * characters in its in-memory value after parsing escape sequences.
 *
 * ## Principles Applied
 * 1.  **Literate Programming**: The `main` function is a narrative, explaining each step
 * from testing to solving both parts of the puzzle. Comments describe the *why* of
 * each step.
 * 2.  **Idiomatic Kotlin**:
 * - **Extension Properties**: Instead of standalone `unescape` and `escape` functions
 * that return a new `String`, we use `String.memoryLength` and `String.encodedLength`
 * extension properties. This is more efficient as it calculates the length directly
 * without allocating a new string. It also makes the call site read more naturally
 * (e.g., `line.memoryLength`).
 * - **Aggregate Functions**: `sumOf` is used to cleanly and expressively sum up the
 * calculated differences for each line, avoiding manual loops.
 * - **Direct Calculation**: The logic avoids creating intermediate strings, leading to
 * better performance and less memory pressure.
